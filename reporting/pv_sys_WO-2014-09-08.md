#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-09-08

#Progress
The PDF is generated, and is available to download from a link/button on the page. 
The basic components are in the PDF, 
but the text formating in the PDF library is not well documented, and will take more time to fix.
The core features of the plans machine are now in place, and development can focus on expanding and improving.

#Plans
Improve the PDF generation. Add more system calculations.
