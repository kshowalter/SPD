#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-08-11

#Progress
The drawing layout has been cleaned up. 
Started changing the page to display the system selection in sections.

Improve the system selection section appearance. 
Add option to only show sections of the drawings as they are defined. 
This will be the default mode for released versions. 
The Dev version will pick defaults and build the complete drawing on page load.
