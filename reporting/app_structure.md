# Plans Machine Application Structure

## Settings
Many of the settings for the application are stored in JSON formated files.
These are what is commonly called configuration files. The settings define what input is requested from the user, and hopefully most of the calculations for the PV system. Some aspects of the drawing may be specified in the settings files.

The JSON format is not unreasonable for a non-programer to edit in a text editor, and can still be imported directly into the application.
A graphical interface to edit and download the latest version of the setting will be provided.
Examples are shown below.

There are other format options for configuration files that might be easier to edit, but would would comprimise the deepth of settings that could be easily specified.
