##Status report for the week of 2015-01-12

#Progress
The display of the roof in the preview section was improved, and module position were added to the roof detail.
The module positions placed on the are the maximum that will fit based on there size and orientation.
The module position can be selected, to designate where modules will be placed.
The system to import settings from a JSON file was removed in favor of the flexibility provided by having them defined in the code.
The JSON file could still be used to submit suggestions.
The inputs can now be defined with units and notes.
