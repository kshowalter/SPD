#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-07-21

#Progress
A few more elements were added to the drawing to make it a better representation of the finish version. 
The development branch was brought into working order, completing the last months code-rewrite. 

#Plans
The last few bugs in the development branch will be fixed, and it will be merged with the master branch. Some more system spec calculations will be added.
