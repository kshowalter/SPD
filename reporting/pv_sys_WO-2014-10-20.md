#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-10-20

#Progress
JSON was selected as the format to move forward with the configuration file system. Input can still be taken from other formats and converted.
The JSON format is not unreasonable for a non-programmer to edit in a text editor, but a graphical interface to edit and download the latest version of the setting will be provided. 
The advantage over other formats is that JSON can be imported directly into the application.
The JSON config file is setup and importing into the application.

#Plans
The config file format needs to be tweaked to allow more details to define the input section of the webpage. A function to build the page from the config file needs to written.
