#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-09-15

#Progress
The initial PDF library had to be abandoned because it was unable to display text with the accuracy needed for a drawing.
A new library was selected, and is in the process of being implemented in the program. 
Currently the generation of a PDF download in the browser only works on modern browsers and IE10+. 
A flash based download could be added for older IE browsers, or a server based PDF generator would work on an browser. 
The current code and PDF library will work on a server with minimal changes. 

#Plans
Finish incorporating the new PDF library, and make sure it can generate the PDF drawing to match the drawing displayed on the web page.

#Development log
* 2014-09-16 16:30:31: Testing another PDF library.
* 2014-09-19 16:50:02: Moved to PDFKit because it has decent support for text placement. It is generating a document and adding lines, text, but still needs to be configured.
