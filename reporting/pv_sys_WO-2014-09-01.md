#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-09-01

#Progress
PDF generation options were explored. 
Currently, the drawing is stored as individual elements, and the elements are used to build the SVG that is shown on the page. 
An additional script needs to be written that will build the PDF and make it available for download. 

#Plans
Finish the PDF build script.
