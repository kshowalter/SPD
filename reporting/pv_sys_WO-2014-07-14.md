#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-07-14

#Progress
A lot of the code cleanup was finished, and the values organization. 
The application will store a lot of values 
(system specs., configuration options, drawing measurements, etc.), 
and they need to be in an object with a decent structure to be passed between modules.

An account with a hosting site was created. 
It provides hosting for the application and it's database, but is not ready for use yet. 
The free account may be enough during this early development phase.

Some formating changes were made to the master branch to improve the current demo.

#Plans
Hopefully finish getting the last 6+ weeks of code ready to merge back into the master branch, and start adding new features.
