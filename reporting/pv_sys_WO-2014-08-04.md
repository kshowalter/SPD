#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-08-04

#Progress
The development branch was in good enough shape to merge it into the master branch as the first alpha release since the demo version.
The system information selectors at the top were switched to a dropdown list. These will work better for longer lists.
Reports from a few partners that have tested the application indicate that IE10 and up work, but IE9 only produces a blank page. 
IE9 was installed on a Windows 7 installation to test future releases the application. 
Keeping the alpha releases compatible with older browsers will not be priority at this stage, but will be done when it does not take much time from the main development.
Before the application is released to a larger group, the compatibility will have to be reviewed. 
Based on browser use surveys, it appears that supporting back to IE8 or even IE9 might cover all but a small percentage of users.
More system values are now calculated, and will be used to display information on the drawing.

#Plans
Continue to add calculations and refine the drawing.
