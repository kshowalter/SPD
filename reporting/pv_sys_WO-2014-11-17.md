#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-11-17

#Progress
Various sections of code were updated or removed to make use of the new configuration system.
More work was done on generating the page.
A script was started to convert the settings.json file to a javascript file.
This should avoid problems with evaluating commands stored in strings.

#Plans
Finish the json conversion script. Finish selector generation.
