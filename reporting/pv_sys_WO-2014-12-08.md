#PV system drawing generator
##Status report for the week of 2014-12-08

#Progress
The rebuild of the value structure and page building was completed.
It will need more tweaking during development, but it is working well enough as it stands now.
The page generation was rebuilt to allow for multiple pages to be made.

#Plans
The pages other than the electrical drawing need to be filled in with content, even if it is temporary.
A way to quickly add tables to the drawing needs to implemented.
The drawing border generation needs to move into a separate function that can be applied to every page.
